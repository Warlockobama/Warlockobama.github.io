---\nlayout: post\ntitle: "How I Made This Blog"\ndate: 2023-10-10\n---\n\nI built this blog using Jekyll and Markdown. I wanted a neo brutalist aesthetic, so I developed a simple, minimal design featuring strong borders, monospaced fonts, and a raw visual style.\n\nThis blog is a space to share my tech experiments, security insights, and projects. Hosting on GitHub Pages makes it easy to updateâ€”just commit new Markdown files to add posts.\n\nEnjoy exploring and updating your blog!
